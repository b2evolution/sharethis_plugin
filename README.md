Using this plugin you can display the ShareThis widget into the contents of your site and let your visitors share them to their preferred social networks and websites.

### Installation

You can use this plugin in your site by following the regular plugins installation process detailed in this manual page: [Plugins available for installation](http://b2evolution.net/man/plugins-available-for-installation).

After having successfully installed the plugin in your site, you need to configure a **ShareThis** account in order to get a `Pub Key`, which is a code with the following format: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX.

1. Go to the [ShareThis website](http://www.sharethis.com/) and register a new user account (if you have not done it yet) and login into the site.
2. Go to [My Account Dashboard - http://www.sharethis.com/account/](http://www.sharethis.com/account/) and copy the `Pub Key` ![ShareThis Pub Key](screenshots/sharethis-pubkey.png)
3. Go back to your b2evolution site and open the plugins settings page of the collection in which you want to display the ShareThis widget: [Plugin Settings](http://b2evolution.net/man/blog-plugin-settings)
4. Enable the plugin for that collection and paste the `Pub Key` code. ![Plugin settings](screenshots/sharethis-blog_plugins_settings.png)

As this is a **Text Renderer plugin**, you may control when to enable / disable it for individual posts by checking the **ShareThis** option in the **Text Renderers** panel of the posts' edition form. ![Text renderers panel](screenshots/sharethis-text_renderers_panel.png)
